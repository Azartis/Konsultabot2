# ü§ñ Testing Gemini in KonsultaBot Mobile App

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed:

1. **Backend Integration**: Gemini is now properly integrated in Django backend
2. **Mobile API**: Mobile app can access Gemini via `/api/chat/send/` and `/api/chat/test-gemini/`
3. **Smart Fallback**: Gemini triggers when local knowledge base confidence is low

## üß™ How to Test Gemini in Mobile App:

### Method 1: Ask Questions Outside Knowledge Base
Try these questions in your mobile app:
- "What is artificial intelligence?"
- "Explain quantum computing"
- "How does machine learning work?"
- "What is blockchain technology?"

**Expected Result**: Should get detailed AI responses marked with "ü§ñ **KonsultaBot AI:**"

### Method 2: Ask General Programming Questions
- "What is Python programming?"
- "How do I learn JavaScript?"
- "What is the difference between HTML and CSS?"

**Expected Result**: Gemini should provide comprehensive answers

### Method 3: Use the Test Endpoint (if you add a test button)
The mobile app now has `apiService.testGemini()` method available.

## üîç How to Verify Gemini is Working:

### In Django Server Logs:
Look for these messages in your Django server console:
```
ü§ñ Trying Gemini for: 'your question' (confidence: 0.x, mode: basic_response)
```

### In Mobile App:
- Responses should be longer and more detailed
- Look for "ü§ñ **KonsultaBot AI:**" prefix
- Mode should show as 'gemini_ai'

## üö® Troubleshooting:

### If Still Getting Knowledge Base Responses:

1. **Check API Key**: Make sure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in backend `.env`
2. **Check Internet**: Gemini requires internet connection
3. **Check Logs**: Look at Django server console for Gemini attempts
4. **Try Different Questions**: Technical questions might match knowledge base first

### Force Gemini Response:
Ask questions that are definitely NOT in the technical knowledge base:
- "Tell me about the history of computers"
- "What are the latest trends in AI?"
- "Explain the concept of cloud computing"

## üì± Mobile App Changes Made:

1. **API Service**: Added `testGemini()` method
2. **Backend**: Gemini integration in `views.py`
3. **Fallback Logic**: Triggers when confidence < 0.8
4. **New Endpoint**: `/api/chat/test-gemini/` for direct testing

## üéØ Expected Behavior:

- **Technical Questions**: Local knowledge base (fast, specific)
- **General Questions**: Gemini AI (detailed, comprehensive)
- **Complex Questions**: Gemini AI (when local confidence is low)

## üîß Debug Commands:

Test from command line:
```bash
# Test Django Gemini integration
python test_mobile_gemini.py

# Test direct Gemini
python gemini_demo.py
```

The mobile app should now use Gemini for questions that aren't well-covered by the local knowledge base!
