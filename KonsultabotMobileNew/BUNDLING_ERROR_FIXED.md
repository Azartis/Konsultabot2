# ✅ Bundling Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

```
Unable to resolve "react-native-worklets" from 
"node_modules\react-native-reanimated\src\initializers.ts"
```

**What Happened:**
- `react-native-reanimated` v4.1.3 was in `devDependencies`
- Version 4.x requires `react-native-worklets` (not compatible with Expo)
- Should be in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
- Wrong version for Expo SDK 54

---

## ✅ **The Fix:**

### **1. Fixed react-native-reanimated:**
```json
// BEFORE:
"devDependencies": {
  "react-native-reanimated": "^4.1.3"  ❌ Wrong!
}

// AFTER:
"dependencies": {
  "react-native-reanimated": "~3.10.0"  ✅ Correct!
}
```

### **2. Why Version 3.10.0?**
- ✅ Compatible with Expo SDK 54
- ✅ Works with React Native 0.81.4
- ✅ Doesn't require react-native-worklets
- ✅ Stable and tested

### **3. Installed Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

---

## 🚀 **How to Run Now:**

### **Option 1: Quick Restart**
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current Expo
# Then run:
.\FIX_BUNDLING_ERROR.bat
```

### **Option 2: Manual**
```powershell
# Stop Expo (Ctrl+C)
# Clear cache and restart:
npx expo start --clear
```

### **Then:**
1. Scan QR code with Expo Go
2. App should build successfully!
3. No more bundling errors!

---

## 📋 **What Was Changed:**

### **File: package.json**
```diff
"dependencies": {
  ...
+ "react-native-reanimated": "~3.10.0",
  ...
}
"devDependencies": {
  ...
- "react-native-reanimated": "^4.1.3"
}
```

**Summary:**
- Moved package to correct location
- Downgraded to compatible version
- Removed worklets dependency requirement

---

## 🔍 **Why This Happened:**

**react-native-reanimated v4.x:**
- New version (released recently)
- Requires `react-native-worklets`
- Not fully compatible with Expo managed workflow
- Meant for bare React Native projects

**react-native-reanimated v3.10.x:**
- ✅ Stable version for Expo
- ✅ No external worklets dependency
- ✅ Fully tested with Expo SDK 54
- ✅ Production-ready
