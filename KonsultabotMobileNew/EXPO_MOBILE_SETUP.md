## Issue 1: QR Code Won't Open on Phone

### Problem
When you scan the Expo QR code with your phone, the app won't open.

### Solutions (Try in order):

#### Solution 1: Use Tunnel Connection (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Stop current Expo server (Ctrl+C)
# Then run with tunnel:
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**Why this works:** Tunnel bypasses network/firewall issues by using Expo's cloud service.

#### Solution 2: Check Network Connection
- Make sure your **phone and computer are on the SAME WiFi network**
- Disable VPN on both devices
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking port 8081

#### Solution 3: Use Expo Go App Correctly
1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent
   - iOS: https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779

2. **Open Expo Go FIRST** before scanning
3. Scan QR code from WITHIN the Expo Go app
4. Wait for bundle to download

#### Solution 4: Manual Connection
If QR code doesn't work:
1. In Expo Go app, tap "Enter URL manually"
2. Type: `exp://192.168.1.17:8081` (use your computer's IP)
3. Press Connect

#### Solution 5: Use Development Build (Advanced)
```bash
# For Android phone:
npx expo run:android

# This builds directly to your phone via USB
```

## Issue 2: Gemini Can't Give Solutions

### Problem
The chatbot isn't providing proper responses.

### Root Cause
Your Gemini API key returns 404 errors (checked in previous fixes). The system SHOULD fall back to:
1. Django Backend (Gemini + Knowledge Base hybrid)
2. Local AI responses
3. Basic fallback responses

### Verification Steps:

#### Step 1: Check Backend Server is Running
```bash
cd backend/django_konsultabot
python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.17:8000
```

You should see:
```
Starting development server at http://192.168.1.17:8000/
```

#### Step 2: Test Backend API Manually
Open browser and go to:
```
http://192.168.1.17:8000/api/v1/chat/
```

You should see an API interface or error page (not a "page not found").

#### Step 3: Check Network Connectivity
In your mobile app console, look for these messages:
```
ü§ñ Trying Gemini API...
‚ùå Gemini API failed (EXPECTED - 404 error)
üåê Calling backend server with Gemini + KB hybrid...
‚úÖ Backend response: [response data]
```

If you see "Backend response" - it's working! ‚úÖ

#### Step 4: Test a Question
Try asking:
- "How do I fix slow computer?"
- "Tell me about WiFi problems"
- "My printer won't work"

You should get detailed responses from either:
- Backend Knowledge Base
- Backend Gemini (if working)
- Local AI fallback

## Quick Troubleshooting Commands

### For Expo Mobile Issues:
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start -c --tunnel

# If that doesn't work, rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### For Backend Issues:
```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend/django_konsultabot
python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.17:8000

# In another terminal, test it:
curl http://192.168.1.17:8000/api/v1/chat/
```

## Expected Flow

### When Everything Works:
```
1. User asks question in mobile app
   ‚Üì
2. Try Gemini API directly ‚Üí 404 (expected)
   ‚Üì
3. Try Django Backend ‚Üí SUCCESS!
   ‚îú‚îÄ Check Knowledge Base first
   ‚îú‚îÄ Try Gemini if KB confidence low
   ‚îî‚îÄ Return intelligent response
   ‚Üì
4. Display response to user ‚úÖ
```

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Frontend fixed to call correct backend URL
- ‚úÖ Backend has Gemini + Knowledge Base working
- ‚úÖ Local AI fallback implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Expo QR code issue (network/setup)

## Still Not Working?

### Check These:

1. **Backend Running?**
   ```bash
   # Should show this running:
   python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.17:8000
   ```

2. **Correct IP Address?**
   - Find your PC's IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
   - Update in `app.json` line 29 if different from `192.168.1.17`

3. **Firewall Blocking?**
   - Allow Python and Node.js through Windows Firewall
   - Allow ports: 8000 (Django) and 8081 (Expo)

4. **Phone App Logs?**
   - Shake phone ‚Üí Open developer menu
   - Enable "Debug JS Remotely"
   - Check console in browser for errors
