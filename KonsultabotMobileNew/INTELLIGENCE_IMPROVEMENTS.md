## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Example 1: Natural Language
**User:** "My computer is dead, nothing happens when I press the power button"

**Bot detects:**
- Problem: "wont turn on" (from "dead", "nothing happens")
- Needs: device type, brand

**Bot:** "What device are you having trouble with? (laptop, desktop, phone, tablet, printer, etc.)"

### Example 2: Context Memory
**User:** "My laptop won't turn on"
**Bot:** "What brand is your laptop? (e.g., HP, Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc.)"
**User:** "HP"
**Bot:** Provides HP-specific solution

**Later in conversation:**
**User:** "It's still not working"
**Bot:** Remembers it's an HP laptop with power issue, asks for more details about what happens

### Example 3: Multiple Variations
**User:** "My notebook is lagging and freezing"

**Bot detects:**
- Device: "notebook" → laptop
- Problem: "slow performance" (from "lagging", "freezing")
- Needs: brand

**Bot:** "What brand is your laptop? (e.g., HP, Dell, Lenovo, Apple, etc.)"

## 📊 Improvements:

1. **Better Detection** - Handles more ways of saying the same thing
2. **Context Awareness** - Remembers conversation history
3. **Smarter Questions** - Only asks what's needed
4. **Natural Flow** - Conversation feels more natural
5. **Better Solutions** - More accurate, brand-specific answers
